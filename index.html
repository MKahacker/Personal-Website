  <h1> My Name is Mahmoud Kahack. </h1>
  <p> I am a code and history enthausist. Yea, those are two completely different things but I can't help but love history. 
      My interest in history accumulates in medieval history, especially the history of the geo-political changes in medieval Europe.
      I am madly in love with low level programing like especially OS development. I am also very interested in security and wish to 
      start my own security firm.
