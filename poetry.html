  <h1> Original Work </h1>
  
  <h2> Writer's Block </h2>
  <p> I sat and couldn't think no more <br>
    My thoughts they walked straight out the door <br>
    And here I sat waiting for more <br>
    Staring at the paper till my eyes were soar<br>
    My notebook empty from A to Z <br>
    What could I do to rhyme with Z <br>
    I sat around and thought of me <br>
    My life and what I ought to be <br>
    Yet, the siege on my mind was unbroken <br>
    My mind was sleeping it seemed broken <br>
    I would stare at the paper and try to write <br>
    But my words seemed to be lost in flight <br>
    I waited waited and then a spark <br>
    I saw over there in the dark <br>
    Suddenly waves of ideas came to be <br>
    And my mind bloomed like the blossom tree <br>
